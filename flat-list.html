        Create four lists using the following information about planets.
        The instructions for each list will introduce the list. 
        You'll need to put paragraph tags around the instructions (like this paragraph). 
        A reminder about the paragraph tag: the only tags that can go inside a paragraph tag are tags the generate content "in the flow of text." 
        So your list can't go inside a paragraph. Any introductory or labeling text needs to be in its own paragraph that ends before the list begins.
